Track record of the live (net) performance of my personal trading account (post 2024-01-01).

Data is recorded as daily fractional changes in USD, using market closing prices, ie 0.1 = 10% change.

The trading system adopts positions in US and UK stocks. Positions are also taken in index and commodity trackers, primarily for hedging purposes.

Headline figures (β relative to SP500 index):  
**α** = 12.5%  (annualised)  
**β** = 0.25  
Sharpe = 1.35 (of **β** neutral returns)

**β-neutral return:**

R<sub>t</sub><sup>β-neutral</sup> = R<sub>t</sub><sup>system</sup> − β · R<sub>t</sub><sup>mkt</sup>
